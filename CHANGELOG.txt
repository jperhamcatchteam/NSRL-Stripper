v1.1 July 2019

Added a checkbox to enable the user to decide if he wants the hash title embedded in line 1, or not. Enabled by default
Interface refresh rate changed to make the refresh rate less often (was 8K rows, now 200K rows), but the processing faster. 
Ensured a default radio selection is on by default (currently SHA-1). Saves the user one less mouse click.
