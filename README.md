# NSRL-Stripper
A simple utility for stripping out just the SHA-1 hashes, or just the MD5 hashes or just the CRC hashes alone from the NSRLFile.txt NSRL hash database. 
It generates a now text file containing the hashes of your choice only, suitable for injestion into tools like X-Ways Forensics and others (XWF actually usually intelligently works it out, but just in case, you can use this).
